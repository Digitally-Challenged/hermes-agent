# Tools, plugins, and skills

Read with [the repository instructions](../../AGENTS.md). Code paths in this
guide are relative to the repository root.

## Adding New Tools

Before adding any tool, settle the footprint question first (see "The
Footprint Ladder" in the Contribution Rubric): most capabilities should NOT
be core tools. For custom or local-only tools, do **not** edit Hermes core.
Use the plugin route instead: create `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/plugin.yaml`
and `~/.hermes/plugins/<name>/__init__.py`, then register tools with
`ctx.register_tool(...)`. Plugin toolsets are discovered automatically and can be
enabled or disabled without touching `tools/` or `toolsets.py`.

Use the built-in route below only when the user is explicitly contributing a new
core Hermes tool that should ship in the base system.

Built-in/core tools require changes in **2 files**:

**1. Create `tools/your_tool.py`:**
```python
import json, os
from tools.registry import registry

def check_requirements() -> bool:
    return bool(os.getenv("EXAMPLE_API_KEY"))

def example_tool(param: str, task_id: str = None) -> str:
    return json.dumps({"success": True, "data": "..."})

registry.register(
    name="example_tool",
    toolset="example",
    schema={"name": "example_tool", "description": "...", "parameters": {...}},
    handler=lambda args, **kw: example_tool(param=args.get("param", ""), task_id=kw.get("task_id")),
    check_fn=check_requirements,
    requires_env=["EXAMPLE_API_KEY"],
)
```

**2. Add to `toolsets.py`** — either `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` (all platforms) or a new toolset. **This step is required:** auto-discovery imports the tool and registers its schema, but the tool is only *exposed to an agent* if its name appears in a toolset. `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` is not dead code — it's the default bundle every platform's base toolset inherits from.

Auto-discovery: any `tools/*.py` file with a top-level `registry.register()` call is imported automatically — no manual import list to maintain. Wiring into a toolset is still a deliberate, manual step.

The registry handles schema collection, dispatch, availability checking, and error wrapping. All handlers MUST return a JSON string.

**Path references in tool schemas**: If the schema description mentions file paths (e.g. default output directories), use `display_hermes_home()` to make them profile-aware. The schema is generated at import time, which is after `_apply_profile_override()` sets `HERMES_HOME`.

**State files**: If a tool stores persistent state (caches, logs, checkpoints), use `get_hermes_home()` for the base directory — never `Path.home() / ".hermes"`. This ensures each profile gets its own state.

**Agent-level tools** (todo, memory): intercepted by `run_agent.py` before `handle_function_call()`. See `tools/todo_tool.py` for the pattern.

## Plugins

Hermes has two plugin surfaces. Both live under `plugins/` in the repo so
repo-shipped plugins can be discovered alongside user-installed ones in
`~/.hermes/plugins/` and pip-installed entry points.

### General plugins (`hermes_cli/plugins.py` + `plugins/<name>/`)

`PluginManager` discovers plugins from `~/.hermes/plugins/`, `./.hermes/plugins/`,
and pip entry points. Each plugin exposes a `register(ctx)` function that
can:

- Register Python-callback lifecycle hooks:
  `pre_tool_call`, `post_tool_call`, `pre_llm_call`, `post_llm_call`,
  `on_session_start`, `on_session_end`
- Register new tools via `ctx.register_tool(...)`
- Register CLI subcommands via `ctx.register_cli_command(...)` — the
  plugin's argparse tree is wired into `hermes` at startup so
  `hermes <pluginname> <subcmd>` works with no change to `main.py`

Hooks are invoked from `model_tools.py` (pre/post tool) and `run_agent.py`
(lifecycle). **Discovery timing pitfall:** `discover_plugins()` only runs
as a side effect of importing `model_tools.py`. Code paths that read plugin
state without importing `model_tools.py` first must call `discover_plugins()`
explicitly (it's idempotent).

#### Native plugin compatibility policy

The canonical contract and deprecation policy live in
`website/docs/developer-guide/plugins/index.md#native-plugin-compatibility-contract`.
Compatibility is enforced as a behavior contract, not through a monolithic
`PLUGIN_API_VERSION`, a manifest-wide native `api:` match, or version literals
on unrelated payloads. Keep documented plugin surfaces additive:

- add hook payload data as keyword fields; signature-inspect callbacks so old
  narrow signatures receive only fields they declare, while `**kwargs`
  callbacks receive the complete payload;
- do not remove or rename `PluginContext` methods; make new parameters optional
  with defaults and keyword-only where possible;
- ignore unknown native manifest fields;
- give new provider methods default implementations, and signature-inspect
  optional callback kwargs rather than forwarding them unconditionally;
- use a local schema version only for a capability with a wire or persisted
  contract, and preserve old state/config/session replay or ship a migration.

Deprecations require a once-per-process warning, a documented replacement and
migration note, and at least two subsequent minor releases before removal.
Compatibility tests must load frozen plugins through the real discovery path
and assert outcomes. Do not replace these with exact registry/catalog counts,
source-reading tests, or assertions that a global version literal changed.

### Memory-provider plugins (`plugins/memory/<name>/`)

Separate discovery system for pluggable memory backends. Current built-in
providers include **honcho, mem0, supermemory, byterover, hindsight,
holographic, openviking, retaindb**.

Discovery covers the same four sources as the general `PluginManager` —
bundled, `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/`, `./.hermes/plugins/` (opt-in via
`HERMES_ENABLE_PROJECT_PLUGINS`), and `hermes_agent.memory_providers` entry
points — but with **bundled-first** precedence, the reverse of the general
system's later-wins order: a memory provider is activated by name, so a
dropped-in directory must not be able to shadow a shipped one. Discovery
enumerates without importing; nothing runs until `memory.provider` names it.

Each provider implements the `MemoryProvider` ABC (see `agent/memory_provider.py`)
and is orchestrated by `agent/memory_manager.py`. Lifecycle hooks include
`sync_turn(turn_messages)`, `prefetch(query)`, `shutdown()`, and optional
`post_setup(hermes_home, config)` for setup-wizard integration.

**CLI commands via `plugins/memory/<name>/cli.py`:** if a memory plugin
defines `register_cli(subparser)`, `discover_plugin_cli_commands()` finds
it at argparse setup time and wires it into `hermes <plugin>`. The
framework only exposes CLI commands for the **currently active** memory
provider (read from `memory.provider` in config.yaml), so disabled
providers don't clutter `hermes --help`.

**Rule (Teknium, May 2026):** plugins MUST NOT modify core files
(`run_agent.py`, `cli.py`, `gateway/run.py`, `hermes_cli/main.py`, etc.).
If a plugin needs a capability the framework doesn't expose, expand the
generic plugin surface (new hook, new ctx method) — never hardcode
plugin-specific logic into core. PR #5295 removed 95 lines of hardcoded
honcho argparse from `main.py` for exactly this reason.

**No new in-tree memory providers (policy, May 2026):** the set of
built-in memory providers under `plugins/memory/` is closed. New memory
backends must ship as **standalone plugin repos** that users install
into `~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via pip entry points) — they implement
the same `MemoryProvider` ABC, register through the same discovery
path, and integrate via `hermes memory setup` / `post_setup()` without
landing in this tree. PRs that add a new directory under
`plugins/memory/` will be closed with a pointer to publish the
provider as its own repo. Existing in-tree providers stay; bug fixes
to them are welcome.

**No new third-party-product plugins in-tree (policy, June 2026):** the
same rule applies beyond memory providers. Plugins that integrate
someone else's product or project — observability/metrics backends,
vendor SaaS connectors, analytics dashboards, paid-service tie-ins —
must ship as **standalone plugin repos** that users install into
`~/.hermes/plugins/` (or via pip entry points). They register through
the existing plugin discovery path and use the ABCs/hooks/ctx surface
we expose; nothing special is needed in core. The reason is
maintenance load: every product we absorb into the tree becomes our
burden to keep working against a fast-moving core, for a backend we
don't own. Promote standalone plugins in the Nous Research Discord
(`#plugins-skills-and-skins`). PRs that add such a directory under
`plugins/` are closed with a pointer to publish it as its own repo —
this is a coupling decision, not a quality judgment. (The
`observability/`, `kanban/`, `disk-cleanup/`, etc. directories already
in the tree are existing precedent, not an invitation to add more
third-party-product plugins alongside them.)

### Model-provider plugins (`plugins/model-providers/<name>/`)

Every inference backend (openrouter, anthropic, gmi, deepseek, nvidia, …)
ships as a plugin here. Each plugin's `__init__.py` calls
`providers.register_provider(ProviderProfile(...))` at module load.
`providers/__init__.py._discover_providers()` is a **lazy, separate
discovery system** — scanned on first `get_provider_profile()` or
`list_providers()` call, NOT by the general PluginManager.

Scan order:
1. Bundled: `<repo>/plugins/model-providers/<name>/`
2. User: `$HERMES_HOME/plugins/model-providers/<name>/`
3. Legacy: `<repo>/providers/<name>.py` (back-compat)

User plugins of the same name override bundled ones — `register_provider()`
is last-writer-wins. This lets third parties swap out any built-in
profile without a repo patch.

The general PluginManager records `kind: model-provider` manifests but does
NOT import them (would double-instantiate `ProviderProfile`). Plugins
without an explicit `kind:` get auto-coerced via a source-text heuristic
(`register_provider` + `ProviderProfile` in `__init__.py`).

Full authoring guide: `website/docs/developer-guide/model-provider-plugin.md`.

### Dashboard / context-engine / image-gen plugin directories

`plugins/context_engine/`, `plugins/image_gen/`, etc. follow the same
pattern (ABC + orchestrator + per-plugin directory). Context engines
plug into `agent/context_engine.py`; image-gen providers into
`agent/image_gen_provider.py`. Reference / docs-companion plugins
(`example-dashboard`, `strike-freedom-cockpit`, `plugin-llm-example`,
`plugin-llm-async-example`) live in the
[`hermes-example-plugins`](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-example-plugins)
companion repo, not in this tree.

## Skills

Two parallel surfaces:

- **`skills/`** — built-in skills shipped and loadable by default.
  Organized by category directories (e.g. `skills/github/`, `skills/mlops/`).
- **`optional-skills/`** — heavier or niche skills shipped with the repo but
  NOT active by default. Installed explicitly via
  `hermes skills install official/<category>/<skill>`. Adapter lives in
  `tools/skills_hub.py` (`OptionalSkillSource`). Categories include
  `autonomous-ai-agents`, `blockchain`, `communication`, `creative`,
  `devops`, `email`, `health`, `mcp`, `migration`, `mlops`, `productivity`,
  `research`, `security`, `web-development`.

When reviewing skill PRs, check which directory they target — heavy-dep or
niche skills belong in `optional-skills/`.

### SKILL.md frontmatter

Standard fields: `name`, `description`, `version`, `author`, `license`,
`platforms` (OS-gating list: `[macos]`, `[linux, macos]`, ...),
`metadata.hermes.tags`, `metadata.hermes.category`,
`metadata.hermes.related_skills`, `metadata.hermes.config` (config.yaml
settings the skill needs — stored under `skills.config.<key>`, prompted
during setup, injected at load time).

Top-level `tags:` and `category:` are also accepted and mirrored from
`metadata.hermes.*` by the loader.

### Skill authoring standards (HARDLINE)

Every new or modernized skill — bundled, optional, or contributed —
must meet these standards before merge. Reviewers reject PRs that
violate them.

1. **`description` ≤ 60 characters, one sentence, ends with a period.**
   Long descriptions bloat skill listings and dilute the model's
   attention when many skills are loaded. State the capability, not
   the implementation. No marketing words ("powerful",
   "comprehensive", "seamless", "advanced"). Don't repeat the skill
   name. Verify with:
   ```python
   import re, pathlib
   m = re.search(r'^description: (.*)$',
                 pathlib.Path('skills/<cat>/<name>/SKILL.md').read_text(),
                 re.MULTILINE)
   assert len(m.group(1)) <= 60, len(m.group(1))
   ```

2. **Tools referenced in SKILL.md prose must be native Hermes tools or
   MCP servers the skill explicitly expects.** When the skill needs a
   capability, point at the proper tool by name in backticks
   (`` `terminal` ``, `` `web_extract` ``, `` `read_file` ``,
   `` `patch` ``, `` `search_files` ``, `` `vision_analyze` ``,
   `` `browser_navigate` ``, `` `delegate_task` ``, etc.). Do NOT
   name shell utilities the agent already has wrapped — `grep` →
   `search_files`, `cat`/`head`/`tail` → `read_file`, `sed`/`awk` →
   `patch`, `find`/`ls` → `search_files target='files'`. If the skill
   depends on an MCP server, name the MCP server and document the
   expected setup in `## Prerequisites`. Anything else (third-party
   CLIs, shell pipelines, etc.) is fair game inside script files but
   should not be the headline interaction surface in the prose.

3. **`platforms:` gating audited against actual script imports.**
   Skills that use POSIX-only primitives (`fcntl`, `termios`,
   `os.setsid`, `os.kill(pid, 0)` for liveness, `/proc`, `/tmp`
   hardcoded, `signal.SIGKILL`, bash heredocs, `osascript`, `apt`,
   `systemctl`) must declare their supported platforms. Default
   posture: try to fix it cross-platform first — `tempfile.gettempdir`,
   `pathlib.Path`, `psutil.pid_exists`, Python-level filtering instead
   of `grep`. Gate to a narrower set only when the dependency is
   genuinely platform-bound.

4. **`author` credits the human contributor first.** For external
   contributions, the contributor's real name + GitHub handle goes
   first; "Hermes Agent" is the secondary collaborator. If the
   contributor's commit shows "Hermes Agent" as author (because they
   used Hermes to draft the skill), replace it with their actual name
   — credit the human, not the tool.

5. **SKILL.md body uses the modern section order.** `# <Skill> Skill`
   title, 2-3 sentence intro stating what it does and doesn't do,
   `## When to Use`, `## Prerequisites`, `## How to Run`,
   `## Quick Reference`, `## Procedure`, `## Pitfalls`,
   `## Verification`. Target ~200 lines for a complex skill,
   ~100 lines for a simple one. Cut redundant intro fluff, marketing
   prose, and re-explanations of env vars already in
   `## Prerequisites`.

6. **Scripts go in `scripts/`, references in `references/`,
   templates in `templates/`.** Don't expect the model to inline-write
   parsers, XML walkers, or non-trivial logic every call — ship a
   helper script. Reference it from SKILL.md by path relative to the
   skill directory.

7. **Tests live at `tests/skills/test_<skill>_skill.py`** and use only
   stdlib + pytest + `unittest.mock`. No live network calls. Run via
   `scripts/run_tests.sh tests/skills/test_<skill>_skill.py -q`.

8. **`.env.example` additions are isolated to a clearly delimited
   block.** Don't touch the surrounding file — contributor-supplied
   `.env.example` versions are usually stale and edits outside the
   skill's own block must be dropped during salvage.

The full salvage / modernization checklist for external skill PRs
lives in the `hermes-agent-dev` skill at
`references/new-skill-pr-salvage.md` — load it before polishing
contributor skill PRs.

## Toolsets

All toolsets are defined in `toolsets.py` as a single `TOOLSETS` dict.
Each platform's adapter picks a base toolset (e.g. Telegram uses
`"messaging"`); `_HERMES_CORE_TOOLS` is the default bundle most
platforms inherit from.

Current toolset keys: `browser`, `clarify`, `code_execution`, `cronjob`,
`debugging`, `delegation`, `discord`, `discord_admin`, `feishu_doc`,
`feishu_drive`, `file`, `homeassistant`, `image_gen`, `kanban`, `memory`,
`messaging`, `moa`, `rl`, `safe`, `search`, `session_search`, `skills`,
`spotify`, `terminal`, `todo`, `tts`, `video`, `vision`, `web`, `yuanbao`.

Enable/disable per platform via `hermes tools` (the curses UI) or the
`tools.<platform>.enabled` / `tools.<platform>.disabled` lists in
`config.yaml`.
